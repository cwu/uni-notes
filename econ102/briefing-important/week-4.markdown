* This compares to average prices in Nov 2011 that were 2.9% higher than in
  Nov 2010
* But economic policy is driven by the CORE rate of inflation. The core rate
  removes the effect of changes in food and energy prices, among other items
* Core rate fell to 1.9%, from 2.1% in Nov
* As a result, there is no pressure to increase interest rates
