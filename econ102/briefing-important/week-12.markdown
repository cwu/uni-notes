Inflation (CPI) for Feb 2012
Overall: 2.6%, up 2.5% in Jan
Core Rate: 2.3%, up from 2.1%

This is a modest increase in inflation, including core inflation. It is not YET
enough to signal a problem requiring a Bank of Canada's response.

The Government of Ontario presented a budget that was reasonable, staged plan
to reduce the provincial deficit. It proposes a public servant wage freeze and
a reduction in their number.

United States
=============
Federal Reserve again repeated its intention to keep interest rates very low
through 2014. It sees growth as fragile and employment growth below US
historical trend.

US consumer confidence fell in March 2012. Rising gas prices are partly causing
this weaken confidence.

Congress and Mr. Obama appear about to reduce regulations on the financial
industry to "stimulate" employment.

Expect therefore another financial industry failure. The only question is when
and how severe.
