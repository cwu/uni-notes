Greece
------
Agreement among Greece, its creditors and the EU to provide funds to Greece if
Greece further reduces public spending drastically is still not finalized.

Uncertainty is rising

The Greek economy is contracting with no end in sight; there is civil disorder
in the streets. Greece will almost certainly need additional funds since its
debt burden is still unsustainable.

GDP Rate of Growth

4th Quarter: -7%
3rd Quarter: -5%

While Greece is responsible for getting into the situation, EVERYONE involved is
responsible for this chaotic and still ineffective response. European Central Bank
again added money to the banking system.
