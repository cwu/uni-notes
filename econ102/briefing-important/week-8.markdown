Europe
======

An agreement to lend funds to Greece to meet its immediate needs is finally in
place. This merely buys Greece time. Greece will almost certainly need another
bailout. Direct assistance to aid the Greek economy has not been provided.

Private holders of Greek debt have "voluntarily" agreed to accept slightly less
than half of what they are owed.

The European Central Bank is set to inject at least â‚¬400 Billion (half
a trillion dollars).
