Greece
======

* An agreement in which Greece further reduces spending and in turn receives
  additional spending and in turn receives additional funding appears to have
  been reached among Greece, its creditor and the E.U.
* This affects the economies of the E.U. advantageously because it reduces
  uncertainty
* However, there is now serious concern that the reductions in spending being
  demanded of Greece are so severe that the Greek economy is being unnecessarily
  and unreasonably driven into a deep recession. That of course makes it even
  more difficult to meet their debt obligations

China
=====
* Inflation in Jan 2012
* Consumer prices up 4.5% compared to Jan 2011
* This is an increase in inflation compared to Dec when it was 4.1%
* This was mostly driven by sharply rising food prices
* Note that China has mostly recently increased credit slightly to make sure
  growth did not moderate too much. But increased credit could accelerate
  inflation
