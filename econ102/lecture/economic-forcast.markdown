Forecast Winter 2012

Global Economy
==============

Short Term
----------

For the near term: Expect slow growth in US, EU, Japan

There is a clear risk that government cutbacks in the EU may cause a recession
in some of the EU members.

Expect slower Growth in China and India

As a result, Canada's growth will be slow

Medium Term
-----------

Globally, slow growth AT BEST

All countries face an increasing disparity of income that cannot continue.

Many countries face many complex problems (US, China, EU, Japan, etc.)

Some of these problems may not be solved fast enough; solutions are often
unpopular; ALL solutions take time to implement

There is a risk that over the next 5 years that the inability of the US to
address its problems will cause a serious disruption.

SO the global economy is vulnerable to disruptions/dislocations/shocks.

As a RESULT of expected disruptions and dislocations, expect financial markets
to be VOLATILE.

Strengths of the Global Economy
-------------------------------

Offers more opportunities in more places.

Self interest SHOULD force co-operation.

Markets do WORK to mobilize talent and resources.

BUT that does not mean the process is smooth or continuous. Or that it works for
everyone or every country.

Canada - Medium Outlook
-----------------------

Producing strong performance relative to mature economies.

Must be affected by disruptions and maladjustments elsewhere.

Canada has the fiscal, monetary and economic resources to respond to such
disruptions as occur elsewhere.

Canada will continue to disengage from US market.

Our abiding advantage: a culture that does not over react.

Should at last rival best of class in growth.

United States - Medium Outlook
------------------------------

Growth below its historical norm, at best, and erratic.

Deficit has to fall
Taxes HAVE to rise eventually
Interest Rates will rise eventually
US consumption has to stabilize at a lower level than the past

US has the resources, talent and wealth to respond successfully to its
challenges. But can it actually decide to do so?

China - Medium Outlook
----------------------

China needs to address corruption and the role of its state enterprises. Dangers
lurk in its poorly regulated banks and quasi-banks, debt levels are high and the
property market is still too strong.

European Union - Medium Outlook
-------------------------------

The debts of its weaker members continue to pose a serious risk to one of the
world's largest economies.

But the EU also has the talent, resources and wealth to address its problems.
Will it act quickly and effectively enough?

Global Labour Markets
---------------------
Competitive pressures continue to rise sharply and indefinitely.

From the increasing number of competitors around the world AND from technology,
software and expert systems that continue to eliminate professional work.

Plus erratic growth and disruptions.
